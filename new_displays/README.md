# If you have a new R33S/R35S/R36S and you have replaced the main DTB, but you still get a black screen, try using the new DTB files for AmberELEC, which should work with the new displays.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The DTB files from this folder are compatible with all versions up to and including [prerelease-20240331_2102](https://github.com/AmberELEC/AmberELEC-prerelease/releases/tag/prerelease-20240331_2102)
